            <h2>About Gyeongbokgung Palace</h2>
            <p>Gyeongbukdong Palace, also known as Gyeongbokgung Palace, is a former royal palace in Seoul, South Korea. Established in 1395, it was the first royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and is now one of the most significant tourist attractions in the country. The palace was among the first landmarks to be established in Seoul and flourished under the 1418‚Äì1450 reign of Sejong the Great. It was destroyed by fire during the Imjin War in 1592 but was restored in 1868. The palace is a symbol of Korea's long and rich history and is known for its Changing of the Guard ceremony, which takes place twice daily. </p>
