            <h2>About Himeji Castle</h2>
            <p>Himeji Castle is a well-preserved Japanese castle, located in Himeji City, Hyogo Prefecture, and is known as the "White Heron Castle" for its elegant white appearance. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a National Treasure, it is celebrated for its masterful feudal-era architecture, elaborate defensive systems, and enduring structure, having survived centuries of history without major damage. The complex, which was completed in 1609, consists of over 80 buildings and features a maze of winding paths to confuse attackers, along with openings for shooting arrows and dropping stones.</p>
