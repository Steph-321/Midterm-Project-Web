            <h2>About Bukchon Hanok Village</h2>
            <p>Haedong Yonggungsa Temple is a significant Buddhist temple in Busan, South Korea, famous for its unique seaside location, which is rare among Korean temples. Founded in 1376 during the Goryeo dynasty, it's known for its picturesque architecture, panoramic ocean views, and the 108 steps that lead to its entrance, which symbolize the 108 agonies of earthly desire. The temple has been destroyed and rebuilt over time, with the current structure having a history that dates back to the 1930s after a previous destruction during the Imjin Wa.</p>

            <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Clothing : Wear comfortable shoes and modest clothing, and consider visiting during the late afternoon or early morning to avoid large crowds and experience the "golden hour.</li>
                <li>Timing: The temple is breathtaking at sunset, during the "golden hour," but also gets very crowded. To avoid crowds, go early in the morning or late in the afternoon after the bus tours have left. </li>
                <li>Duration: Allow at least 1 to 1.5 hours for a basic visit, and longer if you plan to take many photos. </li>
                <li>Crowds: The temple can be very busy, especially during festivals or on weekends. For a quieter experience, consider visiting during the off-season (December to March) or on a weekday.</li>
                <li>Scenery: The temple is located on the coast with dramatic ocean views. The area features many stairs and narrow paths, so be prepared for a lot of walking.</li>
